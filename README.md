# tinyDataScinceProject
my first Data Science project for my MSc in Data Science

### II.	ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS
Throughout this study, we will work with our data to try and answer the following questions:

1)	How has the unemployment rate changed over the years? And do some regions experience higher unemployment than others?
2)	How does a rise or fall in unemployment rate affect other economic aspects of a country such as GDP??
3)	Does unemployment affect the quality of life of people

### III.	DATA
To gather all appropriate data needed to answer the questions, I must include three different datasets, selecting appropriate features from each one, and combining them into a single data frame that includes those relevant to my questions. 
One dataset contains the unemployment rate of several countries across the years 1991-2021. From this dataset, I will extract the unemployment rate. 

The second data set contains the life expectancy, HDI index, CO2 consumption, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the percentage of service workers for several countries over the years 1998-2018. 

The last dataset contains information about the suicide mortality rate (per 100,000) for several countries over the years 1970-2020.
